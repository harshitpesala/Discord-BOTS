You\'re as useless as the \'ueue' in \'queue\'.
Mirrors can\'t talk.Lucky for you, they can\'t laugh either.
Hey, you have something on your chin... no,the 3rd one down.
You\'re the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard.
You must have been born on a highway cos\' that\'s where most accidents happen.
If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.
When I see your face there's not a thing I would change... except the direction I was walking in.
If i had a dollar for everytime you said something smart,I\'d be broke.
U gae.
